## Tools and modules

> Telegram bot
> 
- The Telegram messenger stands out, compared to competing services such as WhatsApp and Co, especially because of its special function of bots and channels. Freely available application programming interfaces (APIs) make life easier if you want to collect data or automate things.

> PyAutoGUI
> 
- Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. The API is designed to be simple. PyAutoGUI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and runs on Python 2 and 3.

> Pyperclip
> 
- a cross-platform Python module for copy and paste clipboard functions. It works with Python 2 and 3. shutil module offers a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files. In particular, functions are provided that support file copying and removal.

> PyInstaller
> 
- bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python interpreter or any modules
